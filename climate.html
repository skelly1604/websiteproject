			<h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
			<p>Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local, regional and global climates. The change can be caused by natural factors, such as volcanic eruptions and changes in solar radiation, but in recent decades the most significant causes have been human activities that have released large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>

			<h2>Causes of Climate Change</h2>
			<article>
				
				<h3>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>
				<p>The most significant human-induced cause of climate change is the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases trap heat and prevent it from escaping the Earth's atmosphere, causing the planet's temperature to rise.</p>

				<h3>Deforestation</h3>
				<p>Forests absorb carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which makes deforestation a major contributor to climate change. When trees are cut down, the carbon stored in them is released into the atmosphere.</p>

				<h3>Industrialization</h3>
				<p>The rise of industry has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The burning of fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and gas, releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>

			<h2>Effects of Climate Change</h2>
			<article>
			
				<h3>Global Temperature Rise</h3>
				<p>The Earth's temperature has risen about 1Â°C since pre-industrial times. This may not sound like much, but even small changes in temperature can have big effects on the planet.</p>

				<h3>Rising Sea Levels</h3>
				<p>As the Earth's temperature rises, so do sea levels. Melting glaciers and ice sheets are contributing to rising sea levels, which could have disastrous effects on coastal cities and ecosystems.</p>

				<h3>More Extreme Weather</h3>
				<p>Climate change is causing more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and extreme weather events like hurricanes and wildfires.</p>
